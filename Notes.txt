#CHANGELIST#

If I had added new dependencies and use other technologies I would have considered the following:
- Log4j (or similar) to replace the System.out/err calls
- Spring for a number of reasons but primarily dependency injection,improved testability and OAUTH2 authentication
- Mockito (or EasyMock) to add more complete unit testing currently using Junit
